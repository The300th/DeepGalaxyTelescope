# DeepGalaxyTelescope
Cosmological simulations are used for training Deep Learning models aiming at inferring quantities of real data of galaxy clusters, for example <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6.1325D/abstract>. To this end, these simulations are a limitation of the model due to the fact that they do not incoorportate all "unknown" physics of The Universe and instrumental effects and this can lead us to bias results. The objective of this repository is to create more robust models, solving to a certain extent this issue.
